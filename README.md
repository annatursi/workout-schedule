# workout-schedule

Normally I use a typed out 12 week workout schedule on my phone during the school year. However, I grew tired of having to remember what week I was on in my workout plan and having to switch between the plan and my timer. I have automated selecting the workout week and condensed the workout and timer in this webpage.

This site provides a day to day workout schedule depending on the day and week of the year. It is broken down into a 12 week rotation of six days of workouts with Sunday as a rest day. The page gives a checklist of workouts to be completed, with built in timers for timed workouts.
